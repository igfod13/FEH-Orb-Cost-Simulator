# FEH-Orb-Cost-Simulator
Calculates average orb costs to get a unit in Fire Emblem Heroes.


Run the python file for the simulator: python summon_simulator.py

The program will prompt you for banner specifics, but you will need to edit it to change the summon pool.

The jupyter notebook file has more parameters that can be modified.

The matlab file version runs more quickly, but isn't well commented.

The excel file calculates free summon percentages for verification, and estimates mean/median costs.
